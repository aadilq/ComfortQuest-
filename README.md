# ComfortQuest

ComfortQuest is an gamified quiz application that immerses users in a short interactive story - choosing between paths in the City or Forest theme. Each choice maps to categories like Workplace Comedy, Cozy Sitcoms, or Animated Comfort. After four scenes, based off of their choices, users receive personalized recommendations for shows that fit their mood, complete with posters, match scores, episode lengths, seasons, and streaming availability. 

ComfortQuest was created for the Netflix sponsor challenge for ShellHacks 2025. The challenge stated that the task was to build the next generation of interactive entertainment. Additionally, the challenge stated to design and prototype a compelling, choose-your-own-adventure style narrative that goes beyond a linear story. 

When coming up the idea, my team and I had wanted ComfortQuest to be played like a retro pixelated game which is why all of our images and fonts are pixelated. For one the project themes, we wanted to mirror a futuristic city, drawing some inspiration from the popular video CyberPunk. With the assistance of GenAI tools such as Claude, we were able to come up with the city of Neon Vista, which is supposed to be a futuristic city set in the year 2080. On the other hand, if the users were not interested in the city theme, we also created a Forest theme that the users can play the interactive quiz in. 

Please give it a try to see what your tailored comfort shows!
